This is a simple Backbone extension library that gives alternative mechanism to navigate/route between application views.

Conceptually it is based on ViewNavigator from Apache Flex framework so the views can be pushed or popped from the stack. It is useful in the scenario of PhoneGap/Cordova mobile apps development.
