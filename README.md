### What is it?
BackStack is a JavaScript component/extension for [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) it allows you to create nice view
transitions in your HTML5 apps. By default it comes with an implementation of mobile-style slide transitions, fade transitions and no-effect transitions.
It is conceptually based on [ViewNavigator API](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/spark/components/ViewNavigator.html) from mobile SDK of
[Apache Flex framework](http://incubator.apache.org/flex/). It provides developers means to manage stack of views that can be pushed, popped or replaced.

### Why should I use it?
Although you can use it for web development (as I did to create this site) it is especially useful when building mobile applications with PhoneGap/Cordova framework.
Of course if you are using frameworks like [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/), [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/), [jQTouch](http://www.jqtouch.com/) or probably dozen of other mobile UI frameworks you don't need it.

### Where can I find more info about it?
Here is demo site that is actually built with BackStack, be aware that I only tested in on WebKit based browsers as I mainly used it for mobile apps development. So if you are on IE this site many not work for you, sorry for that ;)
